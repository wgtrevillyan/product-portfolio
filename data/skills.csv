When performing data analysis, I aim to quantitatively and broadly understand who the various segments of customers or users are and how they use the product. Typically, this involves writing SQL queries in Redshift or Mode Analytics and manipulating analytics tools such as Amplitude, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, etc. When conducting interviews, I aim to qualitatively and specifically understand who each of the various segments of customers or users are, what they are trying to accomplish, how they are managing to accomplish their goals, how they feel and why. Typically this involves various types of interviews depending on what my objective is at the given time such as customer discovery interviews, customer development interviews, user product feedback interviews, etc. Additionally, I look to gather insights from in-app feedback retrieval mechanisms (surveys, reviews, feedback widgets, etc.). When appropriate, I gather insights from customer success, support, sales, and marketing teams.",2
