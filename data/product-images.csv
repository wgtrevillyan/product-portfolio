It monitors a home's water temperature, pressure, and flow rate. In addition, it analyzes the data it receives and reacts to any anomalies it views as a threat by closing a control valve and shutting off the water to the home. Finally, homeowners can choose to set it in eco mode, and it will, in turn, regulate the control valve, decreasing the average pressure and flow rate by up to 15%. The result is that the homeowner saves money via their water bill and the extended lifespan of their water appliances, such as a water heater."
